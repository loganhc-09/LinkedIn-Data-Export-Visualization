An interactive HTML page that shows what you can do with your LinkedIn data export + AI.

**[View the live page →](YOUR_GITHUB_PAGES_URL)**

## What This Is

I downloaded my LinkedIn data (all 50 CSV files) and used Claude Code to analyze it. This page shows some of the visualizations you can create with your own export.

## Try It Yourself

1. Request your LinkedIn data: Settings → Data Privacy → Get a copy of your data
2. Unzip the files
3. Use the prompts on the page with Claude Code (or your AI tool of choice)
